Spotify is a music streaming service that enables its users to listen to all the world's music at the press of a button as well as offering various ways to discover new music.

To say I learnt a lot at Spotify would be an understatement—working here was a critical step in my growth as a developer. Before Spotify, I would never touch the command line, but now I cannot imagine my life without it, going so far as to use vim as my editor.

I worked on a variety of projects—initially the marketing (spotify.com) website (using wordpress), followed by a more frontend-heavy stint implementing the now-defunct Spotify Apps API into the desktop client.

This allowed me to experiment with CSS3 and HTML5 features for months while fleshing out a JavaScript API around the raw calls exposed by the client developers, offering third-party developers an awesome app-development experience.

Lastly, I worked on the platform team creating the developer.spotify.com website and attending various events locally and abroad. I also did the occasional public speaking, evangelising the Spotify Apps API.
