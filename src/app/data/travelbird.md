TravelBird was a travel organisation that aimed to solve the paradox of choice when it comes to picking a vacation destination. They worked with partners situated throughout Europe to provide daily deals at excellent prices.

At TravelBird I helped improve the way frontend developers worked by splitting the frontend code out of the existing monolith and instead communicating through a REST API. This allowed us to work without having to run the backend and databases locally.
