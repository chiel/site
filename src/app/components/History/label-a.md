Label A is an agency located in the heart of Amsterdam. I worked as a lead developer on a variety of client projects using various JavaScript libraries. I played a part in standardising development on React, allowing frontend developers to be more productive.

The biggest project I worked on during my time here was Grow-beeâ€”a social network and e-learning tool aimed at businesses. It had the typical social features you'd expect, such as making posts and sharing images, but also had built in tools to create surveys.
