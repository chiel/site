## History

Over the past ~17 years I've held a fairly wide variety of roles at companies of different sizes in a number of different sectors. I got my start at a small agency as a backend developer while I was still in school and now I'm working primarily as a front-end engineer with some ops/backend stuff mixed in at a large enterprise-y corporation.

Below is a timeline of my career, with the big circles representing companies that have had a significant impact on my growth and career, and the smaller ones less so.
