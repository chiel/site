At the start of my career I worked at a couple different companies trying to figure out what I liked while spending an extraordinary amount of time coding in my own time. During this time I worked at a couple of companies:

- **Synetic**—At Synetic I worked as a backend developer, spending most of my time in PHP and MySQL working on their homegrown CMS to improve performance and functionality.
- **Submarine**—At Submarine I worked as a full-stack developer, primarily creating accessible, semantically valid HTML/CSS templates with some light PHP.
- **Grrr**—At Grrr I worked as a frontend developer, creating HTML/CSS templates that others would later augment with JavaScript.
- **Lucius Websystems**—At Lucius I worked as a full-stack developer, creating HTML/CSS templates to be integrated into Drupal as well as coding small JavaScript components.
- **Mediamatic**—At Mediamatic I worked as a full-stack developer, setting up websites in their Anymeta CMS using prerendered templates to put them together.
