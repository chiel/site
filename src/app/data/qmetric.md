QMetric is an insurance company that leverages technology in order to combat the often negative image insurance companies have by prioritising their customers' needs and aim to provide the best service possible.

At QMetric I worked on the Policy Expert website. Most of my time was spent on optimising the various forms used to manage all aspects of purchasing and managing insurances.

During my time here I also worked on a JavaScript library that could build elaborate forms based on a JSON specification that could be shared between the front- and backend to have a single source of truth for display and validation.
