Lemonade is a company that does insurance for the 21st century. Insurance might not sound very hip or cool, but take one look at [the website](https://www.lemonade.com/) and you can immediately tell this is not your average insurance comapny.

A lot of effort is invested into making the experience as seamless and easy as possible for users, from signing up for a policy to filing a claim. A significant percentage of claims is actually handled without any human intervention at all!

I've only just started on my, hopefully lengthy, journey at Lemonade but I can already tell it's going to be great. Stay tuned.
