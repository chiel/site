Lifely is a small group of people who are ridiculously passionate about making products that simply work. Unlike many other agencies, they really form a partnership with clients to deliver something truly outstanding.

I joined Lifely as a frontend developer, contributing to the development of their latest project, Part-upâ€”a startup that enables people to create short-term, project-based teams.

All development for Part-up was done in Meteor, a fairly young (at the time) full-stack JavaScript framework which also took care of build tooling.
