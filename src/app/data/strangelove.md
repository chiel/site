Strangelove is a creative agency based in Amsterdam for the "always on" world. By using their business acumen they aim to provide solutions that are relevant, human-friendly, memorable and above all, simple.

Working as a full-stack developer my first order of business was to give the company website a much-needed makeover. I worked closely with the motion-graphics designer and experimented a lot with parallax-effects. While building this website I even created a library called [kubrick][kubrick] ([get it?][strangelove]) which made it easier to set up such pages.

After that, my work shifted towards building a CMS that could eliminate a lot of the repetitive work setting up new client websites while still allowing for customisation.
